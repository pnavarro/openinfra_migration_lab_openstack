# RHOSO Deployment Ansible Playbooks - Summary

## What Was Created

Based on the AsciiDoc documentation in the `connected` folder, I have created a comprehensive set of Ansible playbooks that automate the entire Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift (RHOSO) deployment process.

## Playbook Structure

### Main Components

1. **`site.yml`** - Main orchestration playbook that runs all deployment phases
2. **`optional-services.yml`** - Separate playbook for enabling Heat and Swift services
3. **`deploy.sh`** - Convenient shell script for running deployments with error checking
4. **`vars/main.yml`** - Centralized configuration with sensible defaults
5. **`inventory/hosts.yml`** - Inventory template that must be customized for your environment

### Role-Based Organization

Each deployment phase has been converted into a dedicated Ansible role:

- **`prerequisites`** - Install NMState, MetalLB operators and verify cert-manager
- **`install-operators`** - Deploy OpenStack operators from the configured repository  
- **`nfs-server`** - Configure NFS storage for Glance and Cinder volumes
- **`network-isolation`** - Set up OpenShift networking for isolated OpenStack networks
- **`security`** - Create required secrets and security configurations
- **`control-plane`** - Deploy the OpenStack control plane services
- **`data-plane`** - Configure compute nodes and deploy data plane
- **`validation`** - Verify deployment and enable access to OpenStack services

## Key Features

### Idempotent Operations
- All tasks use appropriate Ansible modules instead of shell commands where possible
- Safe to run multiple times without causing issues
- Proper error handling and verification steps

### Comprehensive Variable Management
- Network configuration based on the documented IP ranges
- Configurable timeouts for different deployment phases
- Support for multiple compute nodes
- Flexible credential management

### Documentation Mapping
- Each role contains comments mapping back to the original AsciiDoc instructions
- Variable names reflect the documentation terminology
- Task names clearly indicate what manual step is being automated

### Error Handling
- Proper wait conditions for operator installations
- Timeout handling for long-running deployments
- Verification steps after each major deployment phase
- Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

## Files to Configuration Files Mapping

The playbooks automatically handle all the YAML configuration files from the `files` directory:

- `osp-ng-openstack-operator.yaml` → OpenStack operator installation
- `osp-ng-ctlplane-deploy.yaml` → Control plane deployment
- `osp-ng-ctlplane-secret.yaml` → Security secrets creation
- `osp-ng-dataplane-*` files → Data plane configuration
- `osp-ng-nncp-*` files → Network isolation setup
- `osp-ng-netattach.yaml` → Network attachment definitions
- `osp-ng-metal-lb-*` files → MetalLB configuration
- `nfs-cinder-conf` → NFS configuration for Cinder

## Manual Steps Automated

The playbooks eliminate the need for manual execution of these documented steps:

1. **Repository cloning and file preparation** - Automated with proper UUID/GUID replacement
2. **Operator installations** - Full automation with proper wait conditions
3. **Network interface configuration** - Uses nmcli module instead of manual commands
4. **Secret creation** - Automated secret generation and application
5. **Service verification** - Automated status checking and validation
6. **SSH key management** - Automatic key generation and secret creation

## Ready-to-Run Features

### Prerequisites Check
- Validates Ansible version and required collections
- Checks OpenShift CLI access and authentication
- Verifies inventory customization

### Flexible Execution
- Full deployment with single command
- Individual phase execution for troubleshooting
- Optional services can be enabled separately

### Production Ready
- Proper error handling and rollback considerations
- Security best practices for credential management
- Comprehensive logging and status reporting

## Usage

1. **Customize inventory**: Edit `inventory/hosts.yml` with your lab environment details
2. **Run deployment**: Execute `./deploy.sh` or `ansible-playbook site.yml`
3. **Enable optional services**: Run `ansible-playbook optional-services.yml` if needed

The playbooks are designed to be immediately usable after customizing the inventory file with your specific lab environment credentials and hostnames.
